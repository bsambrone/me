# What is this?
So, you've likely seen me in person if you're reading this. It's a readme about my management style plus expectations, and also a really weird thing to have in a doc like this amiright? 

# About me
I loooooove software development. I also love working with people! At some point in my career I made the decision to go the people management route, with my reasoning is that I can help make work a lot better for you. If things are great for you, then they're great for the company. Plus, I get to write code too (sometimes)! I tend to make decisions very quickly, and stand by them. Sometimes things go astray, but I'll own it if they do. I also got your back, always. If you make a decision and things go poorly, then I take the heat for it on your behalf. If things go great, then I broadcast it! I'm very much an extroverted person to a fault, and it can take some getting used to. It doesn't help that I drink red bulls like water. When it comes to code (or anything else for that matter), I'm not always right and I know that. Given org hierarchies, I know that people sometimes don't feel comfortable offering alternatives. This is why I like to speak last, and make clear that I have my engineer hat on and not my manager hat. I'll hammer on this below, but I'm always open to new ideas.

# What I value
What I look for first and foremost is passion in what you do. This can be seen as constantly learning, asking questions, offering suggestions to make not only the codebase better, but life for the entire team. If these things are true, all the rest follows. Very closely following this is personal reponsibility. I subscribe to the DRI model from Apple, which basically means whatever it is you're working on - you own it. Here is a good read on that [DRI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#4f822b0c194c)


# One on Ones
1:1 meetings are super duper important. These are for you, and aren't focused on status updates at work. Unless you want them to be. More importantly I like to focus on career growth. Specifically yours. Let me know where you want to go, and I will do my damnest to help get you there. That said, I expect you to take charge in driving your career, and you can count on me to mentor, advise, guide, or any number of ways of saying that I'll help you do it. As far as frequency goes, these should be every other week at a minimum. More frequent is even better! I'm flexible on format too. Want to go for a stroll, hang out in a meeting room, meet at your desk? I'm cool with any venue.


# Work hours
I work long hours. I don't expect you to. I will actively discourage you from doing so, unless it's clear that you really really like to do it. It's important to me for everyone to have work/life balance, and this means leaving work at work when you're done for the day. I also understand that everyone operates on a different internal clock. Back in the day (like REALLY back in the day) I used to sleep in till 11am, and now I'm woken up by a human alarm clock that is about 3 ft tall and sounds a lot like "I want breakfast". You're situation is probably entirely different, and that's totally fine. So long as we have enough overlap of time in the office together, that's fine by me. Let me know your preferred range, and I won't bother you outside of it.


# Communication
You'll find out pretty quick that my mannerisms are quirky and I'm a straight shooter. Transparency is really important, and I will never lie. If there's something I can't talk about for whatever reason, I'll say so - but this is pretty rare. Generally I'm glued to Slack and you can expect really quick responses from me unless I'm in a meeting. My calendar can at times look like a dumpster fire, but that's my problem and not yours. If you need me, let me know. I will always make time. My job is to make you successful, not manage an inbox. I love face to face interactions, and that always has the quickest response. Following that in response times are phone calls, slack, and email in that order. 


# Feedback
As part of both career growth and daily work stuff, direct feedback is important to me. If something isn't going well, I'll let you know. This includes ways we can turn things around. The inverse is true as well. Feedback is a two way street, so I really want feedback from you too! If I'm doing something you don't like or agree with, let me know! If you don't, odds are I'll never know about it and keep doing that thing. I appreciate direct feedback, and you can always tell me what's on your mind. This feedback process also applies to PRs in code. I fully expect you to offer constructive (emphasis on constructive) critism/comments on code to make it better. I will do the same. It's for the greater good, and also a good learning opportunity.


# Performance
At the end of the day, at any company, you'll eventually ask how your performance is. At no time should this ever be a surprise, because that's what our 1:1's are for! If performance related stuff is a surprise, I'm not doing my job. You can also count on me to always provide air cover for you. This is my job. Happy engineers don't get pulled into dumpster fires and endless meetings, and I want to keep you happy. Happy engineers perform well. Good performance ships clean bug-free code with fun being had in the process. Clean bug-free code (plus fun) makes the company money. Companies like money. Wins for everyone.


# Quirks
I have quirks. Everyone does. Some of mine are:
* I REALLY like proper spelling, even in code comments.
* If you don't speak up and offer opinions in meetings, I tend to repeat myself and ask questions until you do.
* Saying "you got an error" gives me the shivers. Details please.
* When I see code without automated tests I also get the shivers. I don't like the shivers.
* My humor can be that of a 5 year old sometimes. I'm working on it.
